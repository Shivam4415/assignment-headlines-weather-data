SORT 10 Gigabytes of unsorted integer data with 1 gigs of ram and 240 Gigabyte of hard drive.:

1. Read 1 GB of the data in RAM and sort by using quicksort.
2. Write the sorted data to disk.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all of the data is in sorted 1GB chunks (there are 10 GB / 1 GB = 10 chunks), which now need to be merged into one single output file.
4. Now read first index element from each chunk (10 Chunk = 10 elements) and create a MIN-HEAP. A MIN-HEAP will be created and smallest element will be the parent.
5. Now fetch the first elment from Heap and store in your disk.
6. Next read element of second index of first chunk and and push it to MIN-HEAP tree at parent position.
7. Next perform MIN-Heapify to sort all the element.
8. Next REPEAT  STEP-5.
9. Now you will perform STEP-6 but the difference is you will read second element of second chunk.
10. In this way you will get a SORTED ARRAY on your disk.
11. Once all CHUNK is read, finally you will be lef with only 10 elements.
12. In this case you only need to fetch parent element, decrease the Heap by index one and MIN-HEAPIFY the tree.


MIN-HEAP :: A Min-Heap is a complete binary tree in which the value in each internal node is smaller than or equal to the values in the children of that node.
